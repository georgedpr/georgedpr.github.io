<p>I have been a on a search for a new notes app this year, which has made me try Notion, Craft, OneNote, and Obsidian at one time or another. Drafts is my continually homebase for text processing and they just released a new version. There are some great features in the new release, which include implementing scanning with &ldquo;live text&rdquo;.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Drafts has been tested and works great with the new “Live Text” features in iOS 15 and macOS 12. In addition, we have incorporated document scanning to OCR directly in the iOS app.</p>
