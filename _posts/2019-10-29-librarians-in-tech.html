<p>This looks like an <a href="https://schedule.sxsw.com/2020/events/PP94771" target="_blank">amazing panel at SXSW</a> and I would love to attend if I were near the Austin area (plus the food). There has been some great discussions around librarians in tech companies. If youâ€™re looking for a podcast episode you can listen to right now here is a great interview <a href="https://overcast.fm/+FRqqs8tTU" target="_blank">from the fantastic Beyond the Stacks podcast</a> from the Knowledge Manager at Uber.</p>
