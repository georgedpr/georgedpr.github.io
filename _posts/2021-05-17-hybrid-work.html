<p>Google announces their return to work plan.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/life-at-google/hybrid-approach-work/" target="_blank">A hybrid approach to work</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our campuses have been at the heart of our Google community and the majority of our employees still want to be on campus some of the time. Yet many of us would also enjoy the flexibility of working from home a couple days of week, spending time in another city for part of the year, or even moving there permanently. Googleâ€™s future workplace will have room for all of these possibilities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let&rsquo;s hope others follow suit.</p>
