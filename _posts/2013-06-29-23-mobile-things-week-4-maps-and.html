I will be the first to admit that I don't have the greatest sense of direction. There have been several embarrassing situations when I have gotten lost when I really should have known where I was going. Due to these experiences I use maps applications on my phone both when I travel and also when I am exploring unfamiliar parts of the city.<br />
<br />
Since I am an iPhone user I have the standard <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/maps/">Apple Maps application </a>on my phone though&nbsp;I have also downloaded <a href="http://maps.google.com/help/maps/helloworld/iphone/">Google maps for iOS</a>. I don't have any horror stories from the Apple maps application like others in the user community. The only reason I switched is that Apple maps does not support mass transit directions natively and I am a regular mass transit rider. (The Apple maps will point you toward another app though that is one more unnecessary step.) Though while the Google Maps app does have great functionality I do prefer the UI on the Apple maps application (and the also the ability to spin the map in the Apple version.)<br />
<br />
Other than maps I don't use geo location services like Four Square or Latitude. Though I think there could be great value in these services for public or academic libraries as an engagement tool.<br />
