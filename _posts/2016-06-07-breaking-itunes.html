I came across this <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2016/06/07/opinion-podcasts-app-for-os-x/">great article on 9to5mac today</a> on how the podcasts function should be removed from iTunes and made into a stand alone application. I have often thought how ITunes needs to change as it is trying to do so many things for so many people. I have advocated for seperating the media playing section from the more device management section though I thought the article made a succient case for breaking apart the different media functions into seperate apps (it would mirror the iOS at that point too, which seems to be Apples general plan.) I highly recommend you check it and would love to hear your thoughts on the matter. <br />
