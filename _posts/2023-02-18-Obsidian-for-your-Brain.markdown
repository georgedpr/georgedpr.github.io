I have been an Obsidian user for somewhere around two years and I love it though it takes a certain perspective and it is not for everyone. I never could articulate why it was so different and this seems like an interesting take on Obsidian.

> As an IDE for thinking, Obsidian also makes it easy to re-discover and re-find other files that are similar to the file your currently working on. Whether you’re looking at a recipe for chicken and Obsidian reminds you about other chicken recipes. This is why Obsidian is so hard to set up. It’s not a note-taking app. It’s an IDE for working with text files. It just so happens that a lot of times, these text files happen to be notes. Or they can be.
