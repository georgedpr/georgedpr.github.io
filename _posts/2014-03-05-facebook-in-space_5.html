<span style="font-family: inherit;">Many have drawn comparison between the Facebook being in talks to buy Titan Aerospace and <a href="http://www.google.com/loon/">Google's Project Loon</a>, which I think is fair comparison. I agree that if Facebook can provide cheap, free, internet to areas currently being underserved then that opens Facebook to new markets. Much like Google, Facebook makes money when more people use the internet.</span><br />
