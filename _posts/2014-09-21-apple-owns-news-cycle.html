The Apple event earlier in the month had the technology new cycle spinning concerning the new iPhone and iPhone 6 Plus (in addition to iOS 8). I am still on an iPhone 4s (and there are several articles that recommend not updating to iOS* 8**) so I won't be updated to iOS 8 on my phone as without the Touch ID I feel like the additions don't outweigh the potential downfalls for upgrading. I do hope to upgrade soon though for now my phone works perfectly. I did upgrade to iOS 8 on my iPad though, which went smoothly and I love the addition of extensions, which open a whole new world through app interactions. I have really been able to upgrade my workflow for managing news and information intake from the web (I'll probably post about that someday).&nbsp;</div>

Apple then grabbed the news cycle again with Apple building a new sub-section on their site <a href="http://www.apple.com/privacy/">devoted to user privacy </a>and explaining how Apple protects all your data through encryption and how they don't mine your personal data for their own profit. I was excited to read this as I had hoped Apple would leverage focus on premium hardware rather than ads to focus on user privacy to help differentiate themselves from other vendors (see my earlier post <a href="http://www.georgedpr.com/2014/05/icloud-what-i-would-change-about-service.html">here</a>). Technology is increasingly becoming commodified and in order to compete companies to need differentiate their products.</div>

I also wanted to mention that I've added a new section to the email resource guide to include popular plug-ins for Apple Mail (though I hope to include other plug-ins for other products shortly).&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.chungwasoft.com/cargolifter/">Cargo Lifter</a>&nbsp;(Apple Mail): Stop sending attachments via email. This plug-in automatically uploads documents to the cloud and then sends embeds a link to the document in the email. It works with Dropbox, Google Drive, You Send It and other services.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.indev.ca/MailTags.html">Mail Tags&nbsp;</a>(Apple Mail): Adds tagging options to Apple Mail such as Gmail labels or finder tags.</li>
</ul>
</div>
