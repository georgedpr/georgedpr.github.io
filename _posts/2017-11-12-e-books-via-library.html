<p>The Guardian recently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/06/pirated-ebooks-threaten-future-of-serial-novels-warn-authors-maggie-stiefvater">authored an article on whether</a> or not further books in the series get a limited or even get printed due to ebook privacy. I am firm believer in a artists getting their fair share for their creative efforts and pirating ebooks does have an economic impact. </p>

<p>If the financials cost your concern a great source of free and legal ebooks can be your public library. The ebooks are accessible via your library card and be downloaded from anywhere onto your smartphone or tablet. </p>

<p>My local library, the <a href="www.afpls.org/">Fulton County Library</a> offers e-books to patrons thru two different systems: <a href="https://www.hoopladigital.com/">Hoopla</a> and <a href="https://www.overdrive.com/">Overdrive</a>.</p>

<p>Both allow you to download ebooks directly to your smart phone or tablet and are great source of content that simply part of public libraries’ offerings.</p>
