<p>A recent <a href="https://www.apple.com/numbers/" target="_blank">Apple Numbers</a> update included the <a href="https://www.apple.com/numbers/features/" target="_blank">addition of PIVOT tables</a>, which is exciting as it brings feature parity between Numbers and Microsoft’s Excel spreadsheet program on more features.</p>

<p>I having used the feature now for several months I wanted to write about the experience. Overall, the adding PIVOT tables  to the Numbers feature-set is an artful addition and makes Numbers an amazing deal. The PIVOT table feature combined with XLOOKUP makes Numbers a secret weapon in any data analysts toolset especially as the layout-design features in Numbers make creating quick deliverables key easy so you can hack together dashboard-like one-page PDFs for leadership.</p>

The one downside is that if you’re dealing with 15,000+ rows I’ve found that Numbers can be somewhat sluggish in refreshing the PIVOTs though for bootstrapping reporting I can’t recommend this tool enough.</p>
