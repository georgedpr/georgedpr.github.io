<p>Newsletters are a new take on the old media distribution and curation model, which leverages an reliable and old technology: email. (I love email; a wrote about newsletters back in <a href="https://www.georgedpr.com/post/156670517563/the-old-is-new-again-with-newsletters" target="_blank">2017</a>. Since my original writing newsletters have become even more prevelant and now a large player in the email newsletter space is <a href="https://substack.com/" target="_blank">Substack</a> is launching a <a href="https://blog.substack.com/p/new-reader-homepage" target="_blank">reader style app.</a></p>

<p>The Verge has an interesting article on the topic, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22174000/substack-rss-reader-newsletter-subscriptions" target="_blank">which includes a review on beta software a little history on the reader space</a> It is an interesting move as newsletters are seen as response the walled garden approach for social media as email is open though a newsletter company is now offering a reader app to collect your newsletters (it does supposedly allow for users to add RSS feeds).</p>

<p>I will need to check out the reader and also see what the response from others newsletter services like <a href="https://tinyletter.com/" target="_blank">Tiny Letter </a> or <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/" target="_blank">Revue</a>. Is this the start to a new walled garden or just a way to share newsletters?</p>
