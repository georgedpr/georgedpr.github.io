<p>I have been writing more recently about the Mac and my opinions on the recent release of the Macbook Pro. Since then <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-20/how-apple-alienated-mac-loyalists">Mark Gurman published an interesting article on Apple leaving the Apple loyalists behind</a>, which proved to be an interesting read following up on the consternation provided by the Macbook Pro launch. I then listened to the latest Accidental Tech Podcast, <a href="http://atp.fm/episodes/202">which provided great perspective on Guramn&#8217;s article</a> and helped me come to terms that I am officially a cranky Mac user. </p>
