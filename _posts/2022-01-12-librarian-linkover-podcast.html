<p>A favorite podcast series of mine is the Beyond the Stacks: Innovative Careers in Library and Information Science from Simmons University, which was a fantastic series interviewing different information professionals from a variety of different industries.</p>

<p>While that podcast has ended I recently found the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-librarian-linkover/id1558701209" target="_blank">The Librarian Linkover podcast</a>, which seems like spiritual successor and I couldn&rsquo;t recommend more!</p>
