<h1>Broadband Access Still Plagues Users</h1><p><a href="https://href.li/?https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/17/23460070/internet-bill-broadband-survey-data-consumer-reports-cost" target="_blank">What’s wrong with US broadband?</a></p><blockquote class="npf_indented"><p>The state of US broadband is bad. We already know huge portions of the country aren’t getting broadband speeds — but even where they are, those connections are often bogged down by limited options, predatory billing practices, and a general lack of choice.”</p></blockquote><p>I personally think Fiber should be subsidized though are costs associated with Fiber deployment that the article suggests leads to our current billing:</p><blockquote class="npf_indented"><p>In the case of internet access, that technology is satellite internet. The economics of laying fiber encourage this kind of rent-seeking, so maybe escaping fiber will let us build a better kind of telecom?</p></blockquote><p>It seems like wireless access is not a sure fire answer either. I think this requires government regulation and investment in infrastructure to aid the market and provide better choice to users.</p>
