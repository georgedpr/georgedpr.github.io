<p>I like <a href="https://jeffperry.blog" target="_blank">Jeff Perry’s blog</a>, a lot and I realized why as I was catching up on some older posts and I came across this <a href="https://jeffperry.blog/2020/02/28/write-it-down-to-remember-it-now" target="_blank">one about memory and note taking.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I filled my first Field Notes journal I took out a brand new one of the same color and compared them side-by-side. The used one could barely stay closed because the papers had been manhandled so much that they would push on the covers. I also noticed that the old one was significantly dirtier. It was as if someone decided to throw a journal into a muddy puddle and then dried it with a hair-dryer. For some reason when I made these observations I made it my goal to make every notebook I finish look like a shell of its former self.</p>

<p>I have recently returned to taking down notes by hand (due to a bad short term memory also a need to keep the daily juggle inherent in 21st century life) and I have been really enjoying the practice. I had thought about <a href="https://bulletjournal.com/" target="_blank">Bullet Journaling</a> though that ended up being beyond what I needed to so I ended up combing a Bullet Journal-like approach with a <a href="https://ryanholiday.net/how-and-why-to-keep-a-commonplace-book/" target="_blank">Common Place book that I manage thru tagging in the margins</a>. I don’t have the habit down though ideally I want to write everyday. The entries are some to do’s or notes on what I am reading or listening to in that particular moment. </p>

<p>Journaling is a highly personal endeavor. For me, a journal is as much about the process; you’re writing down notes for a future self though in many ways the act is more importantly than the creating a working diary/entry catalog. There is something about the act of writing down the notes that forces your mind to connect with the words better than typing out your text via a smartphone or laptop (which I have done via journaling apps on both platforms). I find it sharpens the mind and helps me focus on the day ahead.</p>
