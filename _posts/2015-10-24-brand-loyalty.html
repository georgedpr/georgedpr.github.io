The market appears to be punishing <a href="https://www.blogger.com/hwww.teslamotors.com/">Tesla</a> due to an unfavorable review by product review bastion consumer reports (on Tuesday, October 20th shares dropped ~$20 in the afternoon before clawing back a slight gain before the closing bell). Having grown up in a Consumer Reports household I can understand the wariness some could have over owning a Tesla given the recent review. Thogh as this <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/20/tesla-shares-plummet-after-consumer-reports-drops-model-s-recommendation">article in Techcrunch</a> points out even though Consumer Reports found owners who had complaints they still thought glowingly of the brand. Automobiles have reached a commodified levle for many consumers as most cars meet the standard needs for average drivers (i.e. they get them from point A to point B) so generating that level of loyalty for a car is fantastic. <br />
