<p>On Thursday Apple is held an event where they confirmed officially the rumored/confirmed via that the release of the new <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2016/10/27/macbook-pro-late-2016/amp/">MacBook Pros</a>.</p>

<p>(If you&#8217;re looking for information on the laptops check out this <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2016/10/27/comparison-heres-how-apples-current-macbook-lineup-looks-in-terms-of-specs-price/#more-452104">9to5 Mac article</a> or <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple website</a>)</p>

<p>It has been years since a new MacBook Pro and nearly a year since the latest update to the MacBook so I was excited about what they were going to release though it ended up being more iterative and less revolutionary. I think the OLED touch bar is interesting from a human-computer interaction perspective though hardly world shattering. As I have said here before though in many ways I miss the Apple of the early 2000s as they were not afraid to innovate in leaps rather small iterative steps. Now they have moved away from the Mac toward the phone and cannot afford to push too hard for fear of alienating their userbase. </p>
