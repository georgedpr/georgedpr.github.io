Corporate libraries and information centers live on shared calendars and scheduling. For arranging meetings with stakeholders and users a shared calendar environment brings many benefits like being able to see attendees calenders and submit time changes if other meetings go long, attendees get over-scheduled etc. The system is also accessible both via the desktop and mobile devices so workers have access to the calendar on the go and in the office.<br />

At a library level a shared calender can also allow for valuable branding and outreach. Training classe, research sessions, and project break-outs can be built into the library calendar so project managers and team principles know when information professionals are available for consults. The library can also use the calendar as way to leverage a valuable though often overlooked asset: meeting space. Conference rooms can be prime territory and the library can leverage their space for collaboration sessions, and other meetings.&nbsp;</div>
