<p>I find fascinating the process for creating any writing be it technical writing or prose or something in between. It is especially relevant lately at the office as we are building out or knowledge base/kbase and nothing makes to  in think about process like documentation.  I love articles on how different users manage their workflows and came across the article below on the <a href="https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2020/8/jeff-taekmans-academic-writing-workflows" target="_blank">Macsparky blog in my feed.</a></p>

  <p>Some criticize my workflow for its complexity, but I can assure you that it is amazingly functional once set up. I can&rsquo;t imagine working any other way.</p>

<p>Writing and documenting any process is a like a iceberg in that the majority of the real work and tears happen below the surface and the user generally only sees the final product. Through integrating our workflows to align with our personal work habits we can make the process easier, but it is never easy.</p>
