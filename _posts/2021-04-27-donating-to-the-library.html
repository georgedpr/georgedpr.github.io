<p>I read the profile in The NY Times on Vartan Gregorian and I thought it provide a unique view into libraries as it relates to private donations in relation to the  venerable New York Public Library.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/nyregion/vartan-gregorian-dead.html?" target="_blank">Vartan Gregorian, Savior of the New York Public Library, Dies at 87 - The New York Times</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He seemed a dubious savior: a short, pudgy scholar who had spent his entire professional life in academic circles. On the day he met the board, he was a half-hour late, and the trustees were talking about selling prized collections, cutting hours of service and closing some branches. He asked only for time, and offered in return a new vision.</p>
  
  <p>“The New York Public Library is a New York and national treasure,” he said. “The branch libraries have made lives and saved lives. The New York Public Library is not a luxury. It is an integral part of New York’s social fabric, its culture, its institutions, its media and its scholarly, artistic and ethnic communities. It deserves the city’s respect, appreciation and support. No, the library is not a cost center! It is an investment in the city’s past and future!”</p>
