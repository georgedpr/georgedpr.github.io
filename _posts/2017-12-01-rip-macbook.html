<p>About a week ago, my MacBook (mid&#8211;2010) finally died. It can’t find the system file and Apple’s restore function can’t repair the disk nor reinstall MacOS. I am not exactly sure what my next steps will be though my laptop is out of the commission for the immediate future. It will probably involve trying the wipe the drive and reinstall the OS or pulling the old drive entirely and replacing it. In either case I would have been in a panic if I didn’t have a back up. All my files and photos are backed up in the cloud and also on local storage so I should have minimal data loss after this event. This is my reminder to back up regularly as the above can happen to anyone and it is best to be prepared (or prepared as you can be).</p>
