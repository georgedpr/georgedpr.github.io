After four sections on professional topics I thought it rather clever to include a “Play Week” in the 23 Things topic selection. I have never been a huge of avatars, journal icons or other image mashups. I have known people who spent hours creating the perfect icons for their <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/">Livejournal</a> or fan videos for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a>. However, I will profess an odd attraction to a particular website for creating avatars:<br />

The cartoon nature behind the avatars always appealed to me and I have been an icon similar to the one shown above for a couple of years. Creating an icon can help create a particular brand on the web and unify profiles between different sites like <a href="http://www.myspace.com/">MySpace</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> or on forums.
