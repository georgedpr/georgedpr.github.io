As some folks may have gathered I can by fairly obsessive about email. I find it fascinating that while there are many alternatives email remains a mainstay for communication. As bandwidth has become cheaper and video technology developed there are many options for video conference, messaging, and photo sharing yet email is still popular.<br />
<br />
Email is hardly a stagnant medium too as new companies develop new products built around email as a platform rather than a simple communication tool. For instance, last month the <a href="http://bostinno.streetwise.co/all-series/unsend-edit-or-auto-expire-emails-with-pluto-mail/">BostonInno profiled a new start-up called Pluto</a> that was created by two law students at Harvard Law.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sendpluto.com/">The email service allows</a> users to have greater control over their email through allowing senders to edit emails prior to them being read and recall them after they have been sent.<br />
<br />
The cultural relevance of email can be explained by many factors: simplicity to understand, implementation, and ubiquity of service options. As email has embedded itself in the psyche of work culture I have created a <a href="http://www.georgedpr.com/p/blog-page.html">special page on my site to collect information on email services, processes, and articles (including why not to use email).</a>&nbsp;As email continues to evolve I hope to build out the page to include further resources and information, and can be useful to folks trying to figure out a use case for email (or why not to use email). If you'd like to suggest resources to include please comment below.<br />
