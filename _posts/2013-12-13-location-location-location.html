Apple recently rolled out their&nbsp;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/12/07/the-open-secret-of-ibeacon-apple-could-have-250m-units-in-the-wild-by-2014/">iBeacon technology across their global retail presence</a>, which will allow stores to push hyper-local alerts to shoppers including information on purchases, alerts concerning Genius Bar appointments etc.<br />

While the retail implications for iBeacon are great the technology could have great implications for public libraries. They could deploy it throughout the library to provide directions, shelving information (though there would be privacy concerns depending on the service), and event information. Though the public library could also deploy the technology across the town and send users alerts about local history, events, and municipal alerts. This would value to town residents, and also boost library outreach.&nbsp;</div>
