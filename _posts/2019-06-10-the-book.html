<p>The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/24/opinion/michelle-obama-becoming.html">ran an opinion article on how the paper book is reclaiming the cultural zeitgeist from online ebooks.</a> As much as I love books (the shape, the smell) I had a library school professor who called books &#8220;containers for information&#8221; rather than artifacts and that has stuck with my thru the years. Still, from a technological perspective the book is remarkable. It requires no power, can be annotated, and is relatively cheap to produce. That is hard to beat.</p>
