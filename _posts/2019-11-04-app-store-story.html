<p>If you’re an iPhone user then I would recommend <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/story/id1372307162" target="_blank">checking out the small write up that Libby got in the App Store</a>. I don’t know the genesis of these type of pro-tip stories are ads or if they are paid content or not though I like how this one ends.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the information age, very much need your support. Licensing that digital content costs money and time. And remember, libraries don’t just offer free books. In many communities, they provide employment workshops, computer certification classes, and free access to a computer and the internet.</p>
