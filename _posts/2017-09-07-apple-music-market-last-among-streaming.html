<p>Today on 9to5 Mac Ben Lovejoy writes about <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2017/09/07/apple-music-popularity-gen-z/amp/">how Apple Music&#8217;s market share is last among streaming services overall though 1st among the 18&#8211;24 market.</a> Furthermore, the overall rankings data included the free tier for other services such as Spotify and Pandora. Apple does not offer a free tier so you&#8217;re really comparing different data sets. When you look at the paid services alone the article shows that Apple leads the market among the 18&#8211;24 market as well as the 25&#8211;34 market, and it is tied for the lead amongst the 35+ crowd. This has been where Apple has always enjoyed being in this place the past concerning their products (see the Mac which had a small market share compared to the PC though generated more money per unit sold.) Apple has never needed to be the biggest in anything and seems to focus on providing value. The added bonus is the continuing growth in Apple&#8217; services revenu.</p>
