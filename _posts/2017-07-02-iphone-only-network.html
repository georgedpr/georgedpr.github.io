<p>Virgin Mobile (in the US) recently announced they will be moving to <a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/17/06/21/virgin-mobile-usa-goes-iphone-exclusive-promises-first-year-of-unlimited-plan-for-1/amp/">an iPhone only network</a> and offer heavy incentives to entice users to join the network. The company is an NVNO operator (a virtual network where they lease time on another network, which in this case is Sprint) </p>

<p>As rumors swirl around Apple acquisitions continues given Apple&#8217;s large pile of money I continually think about Apple buying their own cellular network to further data connections into their devices, while keeping their privacy promises. As talks about a T-Mobile and a Sprint <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-20/sprint-jumps-on-report-deutsche-telekom-favors-t-mobile-merger">merger rise up again</a> it seems like an even more appropriate time for Apple to leverage their resources to pick up a carrier.</p>
