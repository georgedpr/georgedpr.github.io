<p>The past year has been a whirlwind and yet New Years has also come/landed as a complete surprise. I looked through my blog archive the other day and I realized I never did a year round up last year so this will be 2021 and 2022 in review of sorts.</p>

<p>The biggest change is that I have changed jobs and departments this year at MPOW and moved into a role that is generating reports using SQL as opposed to <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E92519_02/pt856pbr3/eng/pt/tpsq/concept_PeopleSoftQueryOverview-c07506.html?pli=ul_d60e23_tpsq" target="_blank">Oracle’s GUI interface PSQuery tool.</a> I had gotten good about using CASE statements and expressions to work around PSQuery’s limitations though it was great to start working directly with the database.</p>

<p>The concept behind using PSQuery and direct/raw SQL is the same though now I get to use features like CTE tables and also have more control over the join criteria and functions. Still, it has been like taking a drink from a fire hose in terms of learning new skills, and tools (I ask using Dbeaver as <a href="https://dbeaver.io/" target="_blank">my IDE in case you’re wondering; it is great.</a>).</p>

<p>In late-breaking esque news, I have been enjoying my time on <a href="https://joinmastodon.org" target="_blank">Mastadon</a> on the <a href="https://libraryland.social" target="_blank">Libraryland Server</a>. It reminds me of the early birdsite where you had interactions with folks and your timeline didn&rsquo;t get bombarded with updates. I also like how it is federated like email so you&rsquo;re not tied to one instance and you can interact with anyone. If you&rsquo;re interested in finding me on Mastadon you can find me at <a href="https://libraryland.social/@georgedpr" target="_blank">@georgedpr@libraryland.social</a>.</p>

<p>I have continued my journey in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management" target="_blank">personal knowledge management tools and processes (i.e. PKM)</a> and relatedly was overjoyed to be added to the Documentation working group at MPOW. I still LOVE software and enjoy trying new tools, which means I have used <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_(Apple)" target="_blank">Apple Notes</a>, <a href="https://agenda.com/" target="_blank">Agenda</a>, <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank">Obsidian</a>, <a href="https://www.notion.so" target="_blank">Notion</a>, <a href="https://www.craft.do" target="_blank">Craft</a>, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onenote/digital-note-taking-app" target="_blank">OneNote</a> at various times. I have settled on Agenda for home-related notes, Obsidian for personal writing, and OneNote at work (though I looking forward to Microsoft Loop being more widely available).</p>

<p>I hope the new year brings more skill growth and also more time to write (though I have said that before and made promises to do better before too) I am trying to give myself grace though rather than sticking to a strict schedule or trying to maintain something I can’t manage. I hope everyone has a great day, and a wonderful year.</p>
