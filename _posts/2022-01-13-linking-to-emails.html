<p>I have been working on a new note taking process for MPOW, which leverages <a href="http://obsidian.md" target="_blank">Obsidian</a> as a 2nd brain and moves away from the analog note process. (This is my latest such note taking overhaul; I’ve tried many different tools for managing my work such as OneNote, Agenda, and simple text files in BBEdit.)</p>

<p>I have found it helpful at times to link from Obsidian back to my inbox for specific notes. If you&rsquo;re on a Mac that is link methodology for referring to emails in Apple Mail which you can imbedded in Obsidian. The article below from the Sweet Set-up outlines the specifics and if you&rsquo;re a Tex Expander user it is easy to set-up a snippet to handle the formatting.</p>
