<p>I have been following the Youtuber (among other roles they play), <a href="https://aliabdaal.com/" target="_blank">Ali Abdaal</a> for a while as I enjoy their tech reviews and productively discussions. In his <a href="https://aliabdaal.com/" target="_blank">weekly newsletter</a> this week he features a piece written by his assistant, <a href="https://youtube.com/channel/UCUFFHXvzAMRSD8Bq4bJppxQ" target="_blank">Elizabeth Filips</a>about her productivity and on why you should “Why You Should Listen To Your Lazy Self”, which is interesting though when I checked out her YouTube channel I found the following video about knowledge information systems.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=96pSnIo4nDg&amp;feature" target="_blank">Why I have a 2nd Brain</a></p>

<p>I am always on the look out for the next best note taking app or to do app as I am perennially over indexed on what I can get done in a day and have a hard time not saying “yes” at the office. </p>

<p>In this video she talks about the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Brains are for making connections and not for storing information. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I found this especially profound and pertinent to how I think about knowledge management and information curation.</p>
