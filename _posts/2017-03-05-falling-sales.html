<p>On one of the more recent episodes of <a href="http://atp.fm/episodes/207">ATP</a> they were discussing the report from Apples latest earnings that iPad sales are continuing to fall. They are not the the only ones <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/www.recode.net/platform/amp/2017/1/31/14460952/apple-ipad-sales-still-falling">to mention it either as Recode</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/why-are-ipad-sales-shrinking-2017-2">Business Insider</a> as well as other news sites have mentines the decline in Apples tablet. </p>

<p>There is much speculation across the punditry on why this is happening (lack of ability for a tablet to do real work, bigger phones have more portability than a tablet with a big enough screen for movies, reading etc).</p>

<p>From peronal experience, I can say that my tablet is several years old and still runs great so I have intention of upgrading in the near future. It is a complementary device to my Mac and iPhone that I use it for consuming media while reading or watching a video. The tablet could not replace my laptop in terms of power or computing flexibility nor my phone in terms of mobilty (and camera). I enjoy my tablet greatly though I can understand greatly while sales have slumped (though by no means are the sales bad; it is just compared to the rarefied sales of the iPhone it is hard to not see the differential.</p>
