<p>The world has quickly moved from remote being a perk to being nexessity. Many haven’t worked remotly before or are trying to adjust to working remotely in a role where it hadn’t been imagined. In a prior role I spent two years working with a remote team and now work about one day a week remotely so I have some experience working outside a traditional office setting. There have been some interesting resources available as both management and employees have to adapt to a shifted paradigm.</p>

<p>I have in included a few articles on remote work below that could be helpful to those beginning to work remotely for the first time or working remotely on a more intense basis.</p>
