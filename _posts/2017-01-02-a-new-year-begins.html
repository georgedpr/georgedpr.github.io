This year has been a year of change on the blog and throughout my professional career trajectory. The blog has settled roughly into a once of month affair, which is less than I had hoped so I am hoping to improve in 2017. At the end of last year, I switched from writing via a web interface to writing via an app, <a href="https://bywordapp.com/">Byword</a>, which has allowed me to write more frequently in smaller time frames (i.e. waiting in line) and also without needing a laptop. This has been great though there some features missing from the web interface such as being able to schedule posts and also share the Google Plus (which has some <a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/google-plus/amp">seo benefits</a>. Though those drawbacks are small compared to being able to have your content saved in a text file and easily accessible outside the blogger CMS. <br />

I have just hit my year anniversary at a new Day Job(TM), and am further bullish on embedded librarianship. I think it is a power future for the profession and also provides real value to organizations. Knowledge workers continue to need support while completing their everyday work and any information/data system requires a champion/expert to help manage the informaton and the tool. Too often practioners are asked to manage the tools they use (or there is no overall management) and spend time managing/finding information where they should be making widgets (i.e. whatever their core function). Having a librarian on staff on help manage the tool and also free up principals to focus on their main duties. I had the chance to speak about being an embedded librarian<a href="http://georgia.sla.org/2015/10/october-28-program-report-embedded-librarians/">in 2015 and would love to chance to </a> to speak again on the topic. <br />
