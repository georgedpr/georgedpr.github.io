<p>The Library of Congress in many ways seems more like a mythical institution than a traditional library so I am always excited when they find ways to leverage their collections in interesting way. I recently came across a recent collection of Free to Use and Reuse <a href="https://www.loc.gov/free-to-use/?loclr=blogloc">sets of digital images</a> where the images are in the public domain or they have been cleared for use (there is an accompanying statement with each item). I particularly love the travel posters <a href="https://www.loc.gov/free-to-use/travel-posters">showing notably American landmarks.</a></p>
