<span style="font-family: inherit;">I was going to write a post about the recent article from <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/06/newly-updated-inbox-pause-utility-lets-you-check-email-on-your-schedule-not-theirs/">Techcrunch concerning the revamped "Inbox Pause" utility</a>&nbsp;from Baydin,&nbsp;which allows users to "pause" their email delivery so they can interact with their inbox at their schedule. (The company behind the utility, <a href="http://www.baydin.com/">Baydin,</a> makes the plugin Boomerang, which runs for <a href="http://www.boomeranggmail.com/">Gmail</a>, and <a href="http://www.baydin.com/boomerang/index.html">Outlook</a>.)</span><br />
