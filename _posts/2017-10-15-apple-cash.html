<p>I am excited about <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2017/10/14/apple-pay-cash-testing-expands-ahead-of-public-release/amp/">Apple Pay Cash</a> is getting closer to release. There are several competing services like Venmo, Square Cash and PayPal though the trouble is always making sure two parties are all on the same system (i.e. Apples to Apples). Given the iPhone install base I am hoping that Apple Pay Cash can help provide a single system that is simple to setup. (Also, there will hopefully be no social feature like Venmo; not everything needs to be social.)</p>
