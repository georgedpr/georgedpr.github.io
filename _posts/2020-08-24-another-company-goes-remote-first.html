<p>Last week Retail Wire noted that <a href="https://retailwire.com/discussion/rei-is-going-remote-and-selling-its-corporate-headquarters/" target="_blank">REI is going remote and selling its corporate headquarters</a>, which makes them another company that is embracing remote work. Though unlike other companies like <a href="https://twitter.com/" target="_blank">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://slack.com" target="_blank">Slack</a> REI is a traditional retail company with brick and mortar stores. I think that remote work is going to become more normalized and written about <a href="https://www.georgedpr.com/post/613561713396187136/remote-work" target="_blank">resources for remote work</a> so seeing more companies embrace remote work is exciting.</p>

<p>There are of course those companies that have always been remote (or distributed) like <a href="https://automattic.com/about/" target="_blank">Automattic</a> or <a href="https://buffer.com/about" target="_blank">Buffer</a> though I think that is easier than moving a company with a more face to face or location oriented culture to an remote model. It will be hard to replace the spontaneity in the hallway meetings and employees will need help to create a way to cross pollinate information though those challenges can exist in face to face environments too. It is all just how you structure your communication and also how you manage your knowledge transfer.</p>
