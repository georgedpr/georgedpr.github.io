<p>Another <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Pinterest-terminate-SF-office-lease-88-Bluxome-15525421.php" target="_blank">company is looking to downsize their corporate footprint</a> in the post-COVID world as they re-think their future office space. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pinterest, a social-sharing site popular for pinning recipes, home inspiration and more, has canceled its large San Francisco office lease. The lease was for 88 Bluxome, a high-rise complex to-be-constructed near Pinterestâ€™s existing San Francisco headquarters. The company cited a shift to work-from-home due to the coronavirus pandemic in its decision. Pinterest will keep its current city offices, however.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This differs from other articles as the company is not shifting to work from home over an office environment though they atleast rethinking their future office needs. </p>
