<p>As mentioned briefly before I am participant in an upcoming webinar for SLA (see official blurb below) about alternative careers in librarianship. This is a topic I am particularly passionate about as I firmly believe in “Big Tent” librarianship is the future of the profession as the we humans create more about data our skillset is ever more relevant. </p>
