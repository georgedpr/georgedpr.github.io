I haven’t posted in a while and in part that was because this fall I embarked on a class on User Research from <a href="http://www.simmons.edu/slis">Simmons University</a>, which between the reading, assignments and group project added significantly onto my normal daily routine making writing an even more hectic experience.<br /><br />
This was my first experience in an online learning environment as well as my first collegiate experience as a working professional with a family. (My education has been largely traditional residential programs for both my <a href="http://www/.goucher.edu">undergraduate</a> and <a href="http://www.simmons.edu/">graduate experience</a>). The class consisted of video lectures and assigned readings every week to support a large group project where we completed an actual user research study throughout the semester. There were also three all-class meetings throughout the semester where we interacted via webinar.<br /><br />
As this was my first online program, it was interesting using the instructional portal (https://moodle.org/) and seeing how the class blended the readings with lectures and live online meet ups. The professor was extremely active and helpful if we had any questions so I felt like the experience was equal to my terrestrial classes. The main advantage was that I didn’t need to be in a certain place and a certain time for class so I could continue my job and also pick up my kid(s) from preschool etc.<br />
The hardest part was managing my own calendar and I could have done a better job juggling the time commitments and also communicating those to my spouse (who I owe a debt of gratitude as I couldn’t have completed the class without her).<br /><br />
The readings and lectures provided an excellent theoretical overview of the user research discipline though I especially loved that the class provided me live experience in the user research process. We had a real client, a large public library, that was hoping to improve their library website. Our group liaisoned with the client, prepared our tasks and user persona, conducted usability sessions and the prepared a final report. Hopefully from the report the library will be able to make some changes to the site and improve the user experience.<br /><br />
The was an amazing experience (albeit exhausting at times) that I would recommend it to anyone. I hope to now take the knowledge and experience I’ve gained to perform some usability research at my day job as I am interested in learning how users access data across our system(s) and how we can improve their experience.
