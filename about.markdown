My name is George Peckham-Rooney and I currently work as a data analyst at a research university in the southeastern United States though I have worked in small research centers, large government digital repositories, international law firms, and academic libraries. 

[My professional background is as a librarian](https://www.simmons.edu/academics/colleges-schools-departments/slis) and I am an advocate for big tent librarianship especially embedded librarianship where librarians work within business units outside a traditional library (such as my current work as a data analyst). I find that my librarian skill set and librarianshipâ€™s focus on the interaction between humans and information to be especially relevant.

Some have questioned whether librarianship (and librarians) is still relevant in the 21st century and I think our work is more important than ever. Information is everywhere, and while the containers have changed (i.e.books) information still needs to be managed, organized, and curated.

For more information on my experience and background check out my [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgedpr/). As time allows I am available for consulting projects and speaking engagements. Please feel free to contact me via email georgedpr (at) icloud.com.

Before becoming a librarian I worked for a wonderful small independent comic book store for many years where I have some great memories, and still enjoy comic books currently. My other interests include cartography, trains, and tabletop roleplaying games.
