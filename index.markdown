My name is George Peckham-Rooney and I am a librarian who currently works in the southeastern United States. I have had many different titles (Data Specialist, Business Analyst, and Data Analyst) yet every position leverages my librarian skills in some way or another. 

If youâ€™re interested learning more about me or my work then [check-out the about]({% link about.markdown}) page and read through my blog posts.
