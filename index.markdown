My name is George Peckham-Rooney and I am a librarian currently working with data via SQL. I have had many different titles (Data Specialist, Business Analyst, and Data Analyst) yet every position leverages my librarian skills in some way or another. 

If youâ€™re interested in learning more about me or my work then check out the {%link about.markdown%} page and look over my blog posts, which cover such topics as databases, knowledge management, and librarianship.
