**About**

I needed to start using GitHub for work and I had only heard about the service so in order to get better at using the service I thought I would try to host a site using GitHub Pages. A domain name later via [Hover](https://www.hover.com) and ttrpgtools.info is born. GitHub with my personal #TTRPG hobby. 


**Design**
This site design is based on the Astral theme from HTML5 Up, which is awesome otherwise, this site would like gray text on a white background. For the creator information about the site please let me know.
